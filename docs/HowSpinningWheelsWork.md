## How spinning wheels work

You create yarn by adding twist into a mass of fibre (wool, cotton, flax), while pulling the fibre lengthwise. 
So you're attenuating the fibre while twisting it. The twist holds the fibres together. 
The thinner the yarn, the more twist is needed to keep it from falling apart.

A spinning wheel adds twist to the fibre, and stores the spun yarn on a bobbin.

With a traditional spinning wheel:
 - You create twist by turning a large drive wheel at typically 30-60 rpm. 
 - The drive wheel is effectively a large pulley; it's connected to a much smaller pulley, which spins faster ( > 200 rpm, depending on the ratio of pulley diameters)
 - The smaller pulley adds twist to the yarn.
 
With an electronic spinning wheel, you create twist by driving the smaller pulley with a motor.
