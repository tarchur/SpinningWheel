## Parts list
Please note that this is a provisional list. 

- [ ] DC motor (they're quieter than AC motors, and can be run from a 12-V power bank. A 5A motor will be necessary. Try to find one with a 6mm shaft, so that it will take a standard sewing machine pulley.
- [ ] Arduino Uno
- [ ] Power source
- [ ] Motor controller / motor shield: H-Bridge (The motor will need to turn the pulley both clockwise and anticlockwise). The motor can't be controlled directly by the Arduino, as it needs a higher power rating.
- [x] Standard-size pulley that will fit onto motor shaft. Use a sewing-machine pulley if possible.
- [x] Pulley, bobbin ans spinning bits for spinning wheel - recycled from a second-hand spinning wheel.
- [ ] box to hold motor
- [x] belt to connect the pulleys - use a sewing machine belt, as they come in standard sizes for popular brands.

Standard tools:
[x] Multimeter
[x] Wire - check the gauge for current spec
[x] drill, screwdriver, saw, chisel, screws, etc
[x] Accurate tools for marking (Important to line the spinning wheel pulley up with the motor shaft pulley)
